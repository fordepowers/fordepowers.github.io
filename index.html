          <p style="text-align: center;">Hello! My name is Ford Powers.</p>
          <p>I'm a <a href="#cybersecurity">cybersecurity engineer</a> by education, a <a href="#software">software
              developer</a> by experience,
            and
            a
            <a href="#tech">tech
              enthusiast</a> by nature.
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0;">I grew up with a love of technology and an insatiable curiosity of how to
            break
            things. This quickly led me to <em>The Dark Artsâ„¢</em> of information assurance and cybersecurity.

          <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
          <p>What originally got me into information assurance wasn't attending a conference or reading some hackernews
            article, it was born out of my love of the cyberpunk genre and characters like the Technomancer.</p>
          <p>I focused that curiosity and when I was 16 I began studying Cybersecurity at Columbia Basin College. While
            still in college I landed a
            full-time internship at <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a> assisting
            an automated software testing team.
          </p>
          <p>In December of 2020 I received my Bachelor's of Applied Science in cybersecurity, and graduated cum laude.
            Shortly after, I was hired on as a Cybersecurity Engineer at PNNL.

        <figure id="software">
          <h2>Software</h2>
          <p>From day one I was writing all kinds of software testing suites to aid in managing a massive
            application quality assurance effort. Including traditional scripting suites like
            <code>Selenium Webdriver</code>, some
            newer stuff in <code>Testng</code> and <code>Cypress</code>, and a lot of <code>Jest</code> unit tests too.
          </p>
          <p>This gave me a really solid appreciation for the artistry of software development. I was able to use my
            education to inject security in the applications we were building: naturally,
            this led me down the directed path of <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_security">software development security</a>.</p>
          <p>And that's where I've been ever since! I never lost my love (or skills!) for making applications. Go check
            out my <a href="#projects">projects</a> to see what I'm coding/brewing/thinking up.</p>

          <h2>Tech</h2>
          <p>Last but not least, I'm a die-hard techie. My interest in the hacker community has led me down some fun
            paths (check out my <a href="#blog">blog</a> & <a href="#projects">projects</a> for some examples).</p>
          <p>Some deep dives I've gone on:

          </summary>
          <hr />
          <p>A few years ago I started my software journey as a quality assurance intern assisting a development team.
            At the time, we used many <i>older</i> industry tools to automate our quality checks, namely Selenium
            Webdriver via Java.</p>
          <p>Fast forward a few years, and now as an older and wiser web developer the task of finding tools to help our
            team identify and triage issues fell into my slot on the Trello board. So, I set out to
            find what's new on the scene and what could help developers with a modern <abbr
              title="MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS">MERN</abbr> stack.</p>
          <h4>Memory Leaks - <a href="https://github.com/nolanlawson/fuite">Fuite</a></h4>
          <p>First up is <code>fuite</code>, a memory leak testing tool. Oddly
            enough, I don't see a lot of <abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr> developers testing
            applications for memory leaks, even though it could be a breaking issue for the user, and one that is
            frustratingly hard to debug.</p>
          <p>Fuite does an excellent job of taking the hassle out of memory testing, by doing all the memory
            consumption comparison for you (in a pretty straightforward and intelligent way) and then gives you actual
            metrics you can use to measure improvement afterwords. I also thought basing the tool off of <a
              href="https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v12.0.1&show=api-class-page">Puppeteer Pages</a> was
            clever, as it's a solid standard and most of us will need to configure custom scenarios so the tool can
            access privileged or
            restricted routes.</p>
          <p>For more info on how to use it, read the <a
              href="https://nolanlawson.com/2021/12/17/introducing-fuite-a-tool-for-finding-memory-leaks-in-web-apps/">official
              blog post & how to guide.</a></p>
          <h4>Load & Stress - <a href="https://locust.io/">Locust.io</a></h4>
          <p>Previously I had experience using JMeter as a stress & load testing tool for a few applications. It worked
            well enough and has a large community supporting it, but I can definitely appreciate why someone made a
            modern tool.</p>
          <p>Pretty much all my previous gripes with JMeter (Java based, clunky interface, high initial time sink) are
            fixed with <code>locust.io</code>. Python-based, gives you metrics and pretty
            graphs out of the box so you can compare results across runs and code updates.</p>
          <p>It's also capable of being much more than just a simple load balancing tool, but it remains easy enough to
            setup for the layman. <i>(Open source is another big plus in my book)</i></p>
          <h4>Integration - <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a></h4>
          <p>Full feature integration testing (end to end testing) is a non-trivial pursuit. Depending on the complexity
            of the application it can require large amounts of code in order to have the automated sequence perform
            well. Having used Selenium Webdriver personally, while it still remains the standard for a number of
            reasons, I don't think those reasons are particularly good. A couple of my grievances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It's unabstract and too specific when writing page interactions</li>
            <li>Selenium is heavy as far as packages go - the Java implementation in particular is not easy to install
            </li>
            <li>It doesn't play nicely at all with any modern <abbr
                title="Continuos Integration/Continuous Deployment">CI/CD</abbr> pipeline- we had to break things to get
              it working</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Cypress is 100% easier and nicer to use. It's also Javascript, which, when you're writing JS anyways for
            development makes life quite a bit easier.</p>
          <h4>Unit - <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a></h4>
          <p>Good ole' Jest. Can't say much really that hasn't already been said, Jest has remained as the standard for
            Javascript unit testing for years, and decidedly deserves it's crown.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It's lightweight (4kb unpacked)</li>
            <li>Extensively documented</li>
            <li>Has a massive community</li>
            <li>It's actively maintained and has deep pockets due to Facebook money</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It also works with all the good stuff like Typescript, Babel and Node, so there's not really a case it
            can't handle.</p>

            <span class="blog">Creating a SFS <time>12.26.2021</time></span>
          </summary>
          <hr />
          <p>This entire site is a single <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file, known as a
            Single-File-Site or SFS. For navigation, it
            simply uses the <code>#anchor</code> suffix (from <a
              href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html">1992</a>) and the <code>:target</code>
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> selector to show and hide pages/content.
          </p>

          <p>There's no JavaScript, no database, no external dependencies, no CDNs to query, no CSS <code>url()</code>
            to
            gather. The entire site is one 16kb transfer. Yet it still works! It will work with screen readers and has
            all the needed
            accessibility features. It scales to mobile and desktop. It even has routing, and can accordion
            expand/contract this blog post section you're reading. All with just native HTML elements and CSS, who knew?
          </p>

          <p><i>
              (Did I
              mention it has a <a
                href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffordepowers.github.io%2F">perfect score on
                Lighthouse?</a>)</i></p>

          <p>I started with the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/cadars/john-doe">john doe template</a> from cadars
            and
            added some flavor for building and hosting. </p>

          <p>Why? After finishing Epic React (which is a great course) I felt too 'in the weeds' of dynamic Javascript
            web
            development, and I wanted to take a step back out into plain ole' HTML.</p>
          <p>Several great developers have started down this path of doing things the real old way, like <a
              href="https://eev.ee/blog/2016/03/06/maybe-we-could-tone-down-the-javascript/">Eevee here.</a> It's pretty
            awesome to be able to edit this website, on my phone, using <a href="https://github.dev">Github's mobile
              editor</a> by typing HTML and then just... publishing... the HTML... like how it used to be. No project
            build dependencies, not even any Jekyll scripts to run on Github's end. Not that there's anything wrong with
            that, it's just nice to remind people that we can in fact do it this way and still have it work.</p>
          <p>There's a bunch of other reasons why one would want to implement such a site - for instance most Tor users
            have Javascript turned entirely off on their browsers for security reasons, this site would still function
            100% in that case.</p>
          <small>Also, my portfolio site could be all fancypants and require the bandwidth of a small nation just to
            load
            the React dependencies but it doesn't
            <b><em>need</em></b> to be. Keeping the attack surface of this site to practically zero keeps me sane. Can't
            have <abbr title="Cross Site Scripting">XSS</abbr>
            if there's literally no <code>script</code> tag on the site.</small>
