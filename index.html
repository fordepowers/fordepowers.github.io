          <p style="text-align: center;">Hello! My name is Ford Powers.</p>
          <p>I'm a <a href="#cybersecurity">cybersecurity engineer</a> by education, a <a href="#software">software
              developer</a> by experience,
            and
            a
            <a href="#tech">tech
              enthusiast</a> by nature.
          </p>
          <p>Like many kids born after Y2k, I grew up with a love of technology and an insatiable curiosity of how to
            break
            things. This quickly led me to <em>The Dark Arts™</em> of information assurance and cybersecurity.
          </p>
        </figure>
        <figure id="cybersecurity">
          <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
          <p>What originally got me into information assurance wasn't attending a conference or reading some hackernews
            article, it was born out of my love of the cyberpunk genre and characters like the Technomancer.</p>
          <p>I focused that curiosity and when I was 16 I began studying Cybersecurity at Columbia Basin College. While
            still in college I landed a
            full-time internship at <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a>, assisting
            an automated software testing team.
          </p>
          <p>Something I think a lot of cyber
            researchers miss is for there to be <em>information assurance</em> there has to first be
            <em>information</em>.
          </p>

          <p>In December of 2020 I received my Bachelor's of Applied Science in cybersecurity, and graduated cum laude.
            Shortly after, I was hired on as a Cybersecurity Engineer at PNNL.
          </p>
        </figure>
        <figure id="software">
          <h2>Software</h2>
          <p>From day one I was writing all kinds of software testing suites to aid in managing a massive
            application quality assurance effort. Including traditional scripting suites like
            <code>Selenium Webdriver</code>, some
            newer stuff in <code>Testng</code> and <code>Cypress</code>, and a lot of <code>Jest</code> unit tests too.
          </p>
          <p>This gave me a really solid appreciation for the artistry of software development. I was able to use my
            education to inject security in the applications we were building: naturally,
            this led me down the directed path of <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_security">software development security</a>.</p>
          <p>And that's where I've been ever since! I never lost my love (or skills!) for making applications. Go check
            out my <a href="#projects">projects</a> to see what I'm coding/brewing/thinking up.</p>
        </figure>
        <figure id="tech">
          <h2>Tech</h2>
          <p>Last but not least, I'm a die-hard techie. My interest in the hacker community has led me down some fun
            paths (check out my <a href="#blog">blog</a> & <a href="#projects">projects</a> for some examples).</p>
          <p>Some deep dives I've gone on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>3D printing (and 3D printer fabrication/customization)</li>
            <li>Arduino programming and embedded systems design</li>
            <li>Portable Raspberry Pi setups <small>(including the infamous Pwnagotchi)</small></li>
            <li>PC building and assembly</li>
            <li>Ethereum development and blockchain programming</li>
            <li>HVAC custom system creation using excess mining rig heat</li>
          </ul>

          Hacking <em>(creating)</em>, hacking <em>(destroying)</em>, hacking <em>(literally, like with an axe)</em>,
          hiking <em>(not to be confused with hacking)</em>, and videography.

        </small> includes videography, so I've included any that I'm proud of.</p>

            <span class="blog">Creating an SFS <time>12.26.2021</time></span>
          </summary>
          <hr />
          <p>This entire site is a single <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file, known as a
            Single-File-Site or SFS. For navigation, it
            simply uses the <code>#anchor</code> suffix (from <a
              href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html">1992</a>) and the <code>:target</code>
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> selector to show and hide pages/content.
          </p>

          <p>There's no JavaScript, no database, no external dependencies, no CDNs to query, no CSS <code>url()</code>
            to
            gather. The entire site is one 16kb transfer. Yet it still works with screen readers and has all the needed
            accessibility features.</p>

          <p>I started with the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/cadars/john-doe">john doe template</a> from cadars
            and
            added some flavor for building and hosting. </p>

          <p>Why? After finishing Epic React (which is a great course) I felt too 'in the weeds' of dynamic Javascript
            web
            development, and I wanted to take a step back out into plain ole' HTML.</p>
          <p>Several great developers have started down this path of doing things the real old way, like <a
              href="https://eev.ee/blog/2016/03/06/maybe-we-could-tone-down-the-javascript/">Eevee here.</a></p>
          <p>There's a bunch of other reasons why one would want to implement such a site - for instance most Tor users
            have Javascript turned entirely off on their browsers for security reasons, this site would still function
            100% in that case.</p>
          <small>Also, my portfolio site could be all fancypants and require the bandwidth of a small nation just to
            load
            the React dependencies but it doesn't
            <b><em>need</em></b> to be. Keeping the attack surface of this site to practically zero keeps me sane. Can't
            have <abbr title="Cross Site Scripting">XSS</abbr>
            if there's literally no <code>script</code> tag on the site.</small>
